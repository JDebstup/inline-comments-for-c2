### In-Line Commenting System for Construct 2

Similar to other programming IDEs, this should allow the developer to insert their comments into the code itself, but not export it afterwards.

Contributions welcome (and needed tbh).

TO-DOs

1) Debug with the plugin, without errors

2) Attempt at removing internal instance variables

3) Remove the "Destroy" action & any others that are not needed

4) Type anything to the input box without restrictions by the IDE (optional)

5) Drink your ovaltine
